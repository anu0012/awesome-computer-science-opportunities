Fellowships types:

Individual fellowships
Pay the salary of a single, usually postdoctoral, researcher
rather than a specific research project. Some come with a
fixed amount of associated research costs.
There are a wide range of Fellowships for academic and
clinical researchers at all different stages of their career,
as well as fellowships to enable a researcher to work in
another country or an academic to work in industry, or vice
versa. Durations vary but are usually for at least six
months up to three years.
